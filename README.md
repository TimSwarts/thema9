# Thema 9 Report and Log
## About
This repository contains the log and full report of the thema9 breast cancer research project, along with all needed data to run the code in the various .Rmd files. Every .Rmd file should have a corresponding .pdf file linked to it, which should prove easier to read and access. This is the log and report repository containing the data analysis corresponding to the java wrapper application as found in the following repository:

## Introduction to the Research
Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on creating algorithms capable of finding underlying patterns in data. This can be done in a unsupervised and a supervised manner. In this research we seek to train a machine learning model to accurately predict a benign or malignant breast cancer outcome based on attributes selected from the ['Breast Cancer Wisconsin Original Dataset from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals'](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+\%28Original\%29).
This data set contains 699, of which 241 are malignant and 458 are benign cases of breast cancer, along with 11 attributes. Data exploration and clean up can be found in `log.pdf`.
